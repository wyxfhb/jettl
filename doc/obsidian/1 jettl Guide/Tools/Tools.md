## Best Practices

All external tools belong in the same common location: `Tools` -> `jettl Tools`.
Please place them in this common location, helping developers easily find your tool!
> Of course, please place company / name specific tools in their own folder as well if further credit should be given to your tool i.e. Tools -> jettl Tools -> YOURNAME -> YOURTOOLNAME.

## Current Native Tools
### Msg Rescript

How To Use:
Only the left two inputs, and Error in are inputs that can be scripted.
Only the right two outputs can be scripted.

Future clean up: `Script Msg.vi`:
Clean Up Wire
invoke node, wire, CleanUpWire

## Rename

both actor and msg renaming:
take the library(s) it is contained in and properly put them in a hierarchical map where the names are in fact unique depending on their path/hierarchy of library(s).

## Future Tools
### Actor Rescript

could be a actor rescript for rescripting the Init.vi to Init.vi where the inputs are the same.

### Disk Moving

Moving Actors and Msgs on disk.
