### Sender Interface

Ability to check out where the message has been sent from.
For a practical example, if a message says to turn on a turbo pump, in the messages method, there can be a conditional check to see if the message came from the creator or self to turn on, depending on if the actor is in an external or internal setpoint state. This could prevent any *miss* messages from actually executing.
