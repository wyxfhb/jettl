for actor and msg renaming:

take the library(s) it is contained in and properly put them in a hierarchical map where the (with an Is Public boolean) names are in fact unique depending on their path?

or maybe not path, but rather the place hierarchy of library(s)?

for the public and private

we can look at the project for XXXX.lvlib:YYYYY.lvlib:ZZZZZ.lvlib:WWWW.lvclass

When a interface message is implemented, but messages method is not implemented, an edit time error is generated in LabVIEW.

We can develop some kind of analyzer test for implemented message methods that don’t have a —msg interface. Ie a message that cannot ever be executed.
—msg indicator for both?
