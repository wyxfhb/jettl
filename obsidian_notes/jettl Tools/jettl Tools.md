for actor and msg renaming:

take the library(s) it is contained in and properly put them in a hierarchical map where the (with an Is Public boolean) names are in fact unique depending on their path?

or maybe not path, but rather the place hierarchy of library(s)?

for the public and private

we can look at the project for XXXX.lvlib:YYYYY.lvlib:ZZZZZ.lvlib:WWWW.lvclass
